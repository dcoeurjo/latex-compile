For some reason, this document causes a pdftex warning to be issued at
the very end of the compilation process (also cf .log):

    No pages of output.
    
    pdfTeX warning: pdflatex: dangling objects discarded, no output file produced.



The problem with  latex-compile lies in the  page/file tracking logic:
once the  final parenthesis (of  the .log output) has  been processed,
then    our   ``stack''    of    included   files    is   empty    and
`tracker_get_current_file`  cannot  pop  from  it,  so  it  throws  an
`AssertionError`
