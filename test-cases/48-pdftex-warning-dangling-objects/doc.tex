% The current version of beamer complains about the `notes` class option:
%
%     compiling doc.tex...
%     in file /opt/local/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/beamer/beamer.cls:
%       Class beamer Warning: This option is obsolete. Use beamer option
%      ``show only notes'' instead. on input line 336.
%
% However, if I indeed change the options, the document compiles just
% fine, which breaks my test-case.
%
% The new document above is an alternate approach to trigger the
% original pdftex error.

For some reason, this document causes a pdftex warning to be issued at
the very end of the compilation process (also cf .log):

    No pages of output.
    
    pdfTeX warning: pdflatex: dangling objects discarded, no output file produced.

The problem with  latex-compile lies in the  page/file tracking logic:
once the  final parenthesis (of  the .log output) has  been processed,
then    our   ``stack''    of    included   files    is   empty    and
`tracker_get_current_file`  cannot  pop  from  it,  so  it  throws  an
`AssertionError`
